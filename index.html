        <p>Hi! I'm a software developer with a social science background living in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
        <p>I'm currently working at MTNA, doing backend development, data quality/management, 
          and marketing work (we're a small team) on projects like Rich Data Services, 
          <a href="http://c2metadata.mtna.us/">the Continuous Capture of Metadata Project</a>, and various others.</p>
      
      <p>One of the highlights of my work has been getting to do some work with the team at <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a>--
        putting together collections of APIs that have been featured in their API Resource Centers (now public workspaces),
        which you can read more about 
         <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2020/07/30/a-very-useful-covid19-data-collection-and-visualization/">here</a>,
         <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2020/09/11/fivethirtyeight-shares-the-election-data-behind-their-articles-and-visualizations/">here</a>, 
        and <a href="https://apievangelist.com/2020/09/10/an-openapi-and-postman-collections-for-the-census-api/">here</a>. 
          </p>
           
         <p>
          I was also thrilled to write a <a href="https://blog.postman.com/personalized-covid-19-alert-system/">post</a> 
         for the Postman guest blogger program around my COVID-19 tracking collection and get featured in the <a href="https://blog.postman.com/community-spotlight-carson-hunter/">community spotlight</a>.
          </p>   
        
         <p>
           A few other things I've been working on lately: 
           <ul>
             <li><a href="https://youtu.be/3Nb8kc79LtM">This video</a> giving a walkthrough of how to use the Rich Data Services platform to explore Paycheck Protection Program loan data</li>
             <li>My first <a href="https://devpost.com/software/docu-mentor">hackathon submission</a>. (Update: we won! You can read more about the thought process behind our project in this Postman <a href="https://blog.postman.com/how-we-built-docu-mentor-to-win-postman-api-hack/">blog post</a>.</li> 
             <li> This <a href="https://www.postman.com/postman-galaxy/upgrade-your-collections-with-documentation/">talk</a> I gave at the 2021 Postman Galaxy Conference.</li>
             <li>During quarantine, I got a spin bike and have been enjoying using the Peloton app--add me at @carrrson if you're also doing some pandemic pedaling. Of course, the most fun part of working out is dissecting the data that comes from it, so I put together a <a href="https://www.postman.com/carrrson/workspace/peloton">Postman workspace</a> to play around with the stats. </li> 
          </ul>
         </p>
